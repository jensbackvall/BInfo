/**
 * Whenever a user attempts to access a page that is restricted to roles they do not have,
 * the application will return a status code of 403, which means Access Denied.<p></p>
 * Following Roles
 * <ul>
 * <li>Admin
 * <li>User
 * </ul><p></p>
 *
 * By default, Spring Security has an ExceptionTranslationFilter defined
 * which handles exceptions of type AuthenticationException and AccessDeniedException.
 * The latter is done through a property called accessDeniedHandler,
 * which uses the AccessDeniedHandlerImpl class.
 * <p>
 * In order to customize this behavior to use our own page that we created (see <a href="/accessDenied">AccessDenied page</a>),
 * we need to override the properties of the ExceptionTranslationFilter class.
 * This can be done through either Java configuration or XML configuration.
 *<br>
 * Using Java, I customized the 403 error handling process by using the accessDeniedHandler()
 * methods while configuring the HttpSecurity element.
 *<br>
 * Using an access denied handler instead of a page has the advantage
 * that we can define custom logic to be executed before redirecting to the 403 page.
 * For this, we created a class that implements the AccessDeniedHandler interface
 * and overrides the handle() method.
 *<br>
 * The custom logic logs a warning message for every access denied attempt
 * containing the user that made the attempt and the protected URL they were trying to access:
 * <p>
 * 2017-11-30 10:42:47.236  WARN 5232 --- [nio-8080-exec-6] d.b.c.CustomAccessDeniedHandler
 * <br>User: user@test.dk[user] attempted to access the protected URL: /apartment<br>
 * This user tried to access /apartment which requied admin rank.
 *
 * <p>
 * More implamentations:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Add the logs to the database, with a page for admins to view logs</li>
 *     <li>Add log file if web application running on dedicated server</li>
 * </ul>
